# Part 1:The XOR Problem

### Why XOR?
---

XOR (exclusive or) is a simple logical operarion:


* If inputs are different-> output 1

* If inputs are the same -> output 0

## The Historical Importance
----

In 1969, Minsky and Papert proved that a single-layer perceptron (one neuron) cannot learn XOR. This caused the first "AI Winter" — people thought neural networks were fundamentally limited.

The solution? Hidden layers. A network with at least one hidden layer CAN learn XOR. This notebook proves it.
