**Knowledge**

-There are two types of Knowledge:
1.Explicit Knowledge
2.Implicit Knowledge

**Intelligence**

-Intelligence is the abolity to achieve goals in a wide range of situations.

**AI**

##Stands for Artificial Intelligence

-Making machines do things that would requires intelligence if a human did them.

###Examples

:1.Recognizing faces.

2.Understanding Languages

3.Playing chess

4.Driving a car

**#Attempt 1: Write the rules**

"If the email contains 'free money"-> spam"

"if temperature > 100F-> fever"

"If the chess piece can move to square and square has enemy piece->capture"

##The is called "Expert Systems" or "Rule Based AI"

** The problem with Rules  **

-How would you write rules for tasks that humans do intuitively?

#Recognizing a Face:

How would you define the exact distance between eyes or the curve of a nose for every possible angle and lighting?

#Understanding Sarcasm:

"Oh. Great." Does it mean something is good,or is it a complaint?Rules can't easily capture tone and context.

#Decoding idioms:

"It's raining cats and dogs." A rule-based system might loook for falling animal instead of understanding the metaphor.

**Attempt #2: Let machines learn:**

-Instead of writing rules... Show the machine thousnad of examples and let it figure out the patterns.

This is called Machine Learning(ML)

**How Machine Learning Works(INtuitively)**

01.Show the machine many examples

02.Machine makes a guess

03.Tell it if was right or wrong

04.Machine adjusts itself slightly

05.Repeat millions of times

#The Analogy:

"Like a child learning by trial and error"

**AI vs ML:**

**Early ML: Modest Successes:**

#What Worked?

-Spam filters got better

-Recommmendations systems(Netflix,Amazon)

-Basic image recognition

#The Bottleneck:

-Couldn't have a conversation

-Couldn't understand a paragraph

-Couldn't recognize objects as well as a toddler

**Why Early ML was limited**

#Bottleneck 01:Not Enough data

- Machine Learning requires massive amounts of exampples to learn patterns effectively.

- Where do you get millions of labelled examples?

-The internet was in its infancy.


#Bottleneck 02

-Learning from data requires intense mathematical calculations.

-Computers were too slow for deep training

-Training on millions of examples would take years


**AI Winters:When Hope Died(Twice)

#1970s Winter

##The first Collapse

-Researchers promised human-level AI in 20 years.When they failed to deleiver, funding dried up 
and internet vanished.

 ##1980s-90s Winter
 
 -Expert Systems were supposed to revolutionize bussiness,but they were too brittle for the real world.Funding vanished again.

 ###"The field become joke.Saying you worked on AI was career suicide."

 
 **WHY AI EXPLODED(AFTER 2012)**
 
 #01.Data
 
 ##The internet
 
 -Massive datasets of text images,and video became available for the first time.
 
 #02.Compute
 
 ##GPUs
 
 -Graphics cards,built for gaming,turned out to be perfect for the math ML needs.
 
 #03.Algorithm
 
 ##Deep Learning
 
 -Researchers finaaly cracked how to train much deeper and more complex neural networks.

 
 **Why Language is Hard for Computers**
